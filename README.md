## Usage:

* In a typical web application, user interactions that trigger DOM events ("click", "keydown", etc…) can be listened for and responded to using an event listener.

* Similarly, in Redux, actions dispatched to the store can be listened for and responded to using the store.subscribe() method. This method accepts one argument: a function, often called a listener, that is executed in response to changes to the store‘s state.
